Okay, don't panic!
<br />

The music should upgrade immediately.

<strong>Alarm Clock</strong> - 
The <img src="clock.png" style="background-color:black"></img> Icon pops up the Alarms menu. <br />
<strong>Chrome must be open for an alarm to work.</strong> <br/>
Here you can enter a time to both play and independently stop the music.
You must enter a time in the format 00:00 for midnight, 00:30 for half past midnight, 14:00 for 2pm and so on. <br />
You can enable or disable each Alarm, and you can set them to recur every day. Tick the boxes to choose. <br />
Hit Save to activate. <br />
<strong>An alarm will trigger when chrome is next opened if Missed.</strong> <br/>

<br /><br />
<strong>The Sleep Timer</strong> is a countdown timer that will stop the music after a number of minutes. <br />
The <img src="clock.png" style="background-color:black"></img> Icon pops up the Alarms menu. <br />
Choose the length of time and hit Go/Stop. This will begin the timer and show how long is left before it stops. 
Click the timer to stop it again. 

<br />
<br />
<strong>Hotkey - Press  Ctrl + Alt + 1 to play or stop the music.</strong><br />
Thank Arunkumar Mahadevan for this feature suggestion on facebook. <br />
There is a Global Hotkey combination that will stop or play the music with the current settings 
even if Chrome is minimized or out of focus. <br />
press Ctrl + Alt + 1 together to play or stop. <br />
If you want to change this Hotkey or if for some reason the Hotkey doesn't activate when you press it, go to Google Chrome Menu, Choose More Settings -> Extensions (or type chrome://extensions into the address bar.)
Once on the Extensions page, click 'Keyboard Shortcuts' at the bottom to choose a new Hotkey. <br />

Previous Feature List:</h3><hr>

New Feature! <br />
Ctrl and Doubleclick anywhere on the player to open it as an App in a new window! 
<br />

<br />
*You can drag and drop the Album Art from the App!
Either to the browser to view it full size, or directly to your desktop to automatically save the picture as a file without any prompts or messing around.
<br />
<br />
* When the new song title hasn't been provided by DI yet, (sometimes it can take a few seconds) the Button flashes the chevrons to show that the App is waiting for a new title.
<br />
<br />
*There are 4 servers across the world, and they all provide (very) high and low(er) quality audio. If you're having problems with streaming audio cutting out, try a different location. Just hit 'Settings', 
<br />
<br />
*Every button and option is labelled in the background for text-to-speech readers that assist the visually impaired.
<br />
<br />
*The Visualisation is being rendered live from the audio. It is not an animation. Try turning up the volume, watch the waveform response change in real-time!
<br />
<br />
*You can change your Listen Key if you lose your device or have it stolen! Digitally Imported have an option on their webpage at DI.fm/settings. You can update this App with a new key anytime.
