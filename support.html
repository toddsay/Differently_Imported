<strong>Chrome must be open for an alarm to work.</strong> <br/>
Here you can enter a time to both play and independently stop the music.
You must enter a time in the format 00:00 for midnight, 00:30 for half past midnight, 14:00 for 2pm and so on. <br />
You can enable or disable each Alarm, and you can set them to recur every day. Tick the boxes to choose. <br />

<strong>Hotkey - Press  Ctrl + Alt + 1 to play or stop the music.</strong><br />
Thank Arunkumar Mahadevan for this feature suggestion on facebook. <br />
There is a Global Hotkey combination that will stop or play the music with the current settings 
even if Chrome is minimized or out of focus. <br />
press Ctrl + Alt + 1 together to play or stop. <br />
If you want to change this Hotkey or if for some reason the Hotkey doesn't activate when you press it, go to Google Chrome Menu, Choose More Settings -> Extensions (or type chrome://extensions into the address bar.)
Once on the Extensions page, click 'Keyboard Shortcuts' at the bottom to choose a new Hotkey. <br />

<h1> Last.fm Setup</h1><a href="#helpm">Back to top</a>
<h4>It's taken a good few days of using last.fm to actually understand what the hell I should be including with it. Apologies for the quick triple-update turnaround and especially if you have had to re-auth for this Liked update. No other way around it. This is the last and only time i'll have to force this.<br>Please feedback, positive or negative, any thoughts on the last.fm features. You're welcome to drop me a comment on facebook as always and help make the app the best it can be. Thanks.</h4>



<br><b>Scrobbling common Answers:</b>
<li>Hit settings to connect your account. You must close all the last.fm popups before DI will pick up your account. If you open DI before the tab has closed, the auth may not take effect and you'll have to repeat the process. </li>
<li>You will know registration has worked by the 'Loved' and the 'Last.fm' Icon showing up. </li>
<li>If you want scrobbling to be automatic, nip into settings and set the option as soon as you're registered. </li>
<li> Scrobbling can be automatic, or manually chosen per-song. If it's automatic, the Loved Icon also lights up to show a previously loved track.</li>
<li>Manual scrobbling means the App will not speak to Last.fm until you tell it to, so it can't tell if you already like a track until you click to scrobble.</li>
<li>Some tracks are not recognised by Last.fm. These will still be scrobbled, but will not be able to be 'Loved'.  -- There is already enough bumf on the screen so there is no feedback if this happens other than the loved icon will not illuminate. </li>

Previous Feature List:</h3><a href="#helpm">Back to top</a><hr>

New Feature! <br />
Ctrl and Doubleclick anywhere on the player to open it as an App in a new window! 
<br />

<br />
*You can drag and drop the Album Art from the App!
Either to the browser to view it full size, or directly to your desktop to automatically save the picture as a file without any prompts or messing around.
<br />
<br />
* When the new song title hasn't been provided by DI yet, (sometimes it can take a few seconds) the Button flashes the chevrons to show that the App is waiting for a new title.
<br />
<br />
*There are 4 servers across the world, and they all provide (very) high and low(er) quality audio. If you're having problems with streaming audio cutting out, try a different location. Just hit 'Settings', 
<br />
<br />
*Every button and option is labelled in the background for text-to-speech readers that assist the visually impaired.
<br />
<br />
*The Visualisation is being rendered live from the audio. It is not an animation. Try turning up the volume, watch the waveform response change in real-time!
<br />
<br />
*You can change your Listen Key if you lose your device or have it stolen! Digitally Imported have an option on their webpage at DI.fm/settings. You can update this App with a new key anytime.
