Differently Imported for DI.fm

I will do a full readme at some point, have a lot of code to tidy now this is public. 
This is my solution to the issue of either needing a tab or an external application open for DI.fm. The
browser is always open so stuck it in there. HTML5, JS/Jquery and the DI.fm API make up the foundation of this.
